    "# Reproducing a Paper - Softconsensus\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will reproduce the functionality described in  [[von Löhneysen et al. - 2023]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/cmb.2024.0519). Below is a brief introduction to the key concepts required for this task. For further details, please refer to the original paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "As discussed in the first part, covariation information from a multiple sequence alignment can improve the folding of the alignment. This is done by **RNAalifold**, which outputs a consensus structure for the alignment. However, the consensus structure cannot always be directly applied to individual sequences. To address this, we will implement a pipeline to construct a secondary structure for an individual sequence of the alignment, which we will name focal sequence from now on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy I: Hard Constraints from the Consensus Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "In this strategy, we will extract all valid base pairs from the consensus structure generated by RNAalifold and use them as hard constraints to refold the focal sequence. In order to filter out nonsensical interactions, the consensus structure must first be modified by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Removing all base pairs with non-compatible nucleotides in the focal sequence.  \n",
    "2. Removing all base pairs where one interaction partner maps to a gap position in the focal sequence.  \n",
    "3. Removing all hairpins with a length less than 3.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures that the constraints are valid in the context of the focal sequence while adopting as many interactions from the consensus structure as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy II: Base Pair Probability and Soft Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will leverage base pair probabilities and soft constraints to refine the folding process. This is achieved by assigning a bonus energy to each valid base pair in the consensus structure. This bonus energy of an interaction is selected to be proportional to its base pairing probability within the ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, the bonus energy for a feature $\\gamma$ (such as a base pair) is calculated as the difference between the free energies of the ensemble with and without the feature $\\gamma$. This approach allows us to incorporate probabilistic information from the ensemble into the folding process, providing a more nuanced and flexible folding improvement compared to hard constraints."
