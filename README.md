# ViennaRNA-Tutorial

Welcome to the GitHub page of the ViennaRNA tutorial.


Here, you will find a collection of Jupyter notebooks that explain the basic functions of the ViennaRNA package and demonstrate its application by replicating the results of recent publications. The notebooks contain detailed explanations, as well as a series of small tasks to test the concepts introduced.


The detailed requirements and dependencies are noted at the start of each notebook. We recommend using Conda to install the ViennaRNA package and other Python libraries. Alternatively, all notebooks are designed to work in a Google Colab environment.


This repository contains two branches. The 'with_solution' branch contains notebooks with example solutions for the provided tasks, whereas those solutions are absent in the main branch.
